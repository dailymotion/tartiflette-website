Tartiflette is available on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/tartiflette/) and you can install it through pip or pipenv. In our tutorial, we would rather use "[pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)" as it embeds both the package management and the virtual environment management.

## Installation dependencies

As Tartiflette based its executor engine on *[libgraphqlparser](https://github.com/graphql/libgraphqlparser)*, you'll need these following binaries in your environment to use the library: `cmake`, `bison` and `flex`.

*MacOSX*
```bash
brew install cmake flex bison
```

*Ubuntu*
```bash
apt-get install cmake flex bison
```

## Installation

Are you ready? We are now going to install Tartiflette!

In our tutorial, we want to expose our GraphQL API through HTTP. To build this API easily and quickly, we're going to use the HTTP distribution of Tartiflette called [`tartiflette-aiohttp`](https://github.com/tartiflette/tartiflette-aiohttp).

```bash
# Create virtualenv
pipenv --python 3.7

# Install Tartiflette
pipenv install tartiflette-aiohttp

# Enter into the virtualenv
pipenv shell
```

It's now time to write your first Tartiflette code, the "Recipes Manager GraphQL API" is coming.
