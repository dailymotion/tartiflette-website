We are going to create a Tartiflette recipes manager GraphQL API, an exciting application which will allow you to manage efficiently all your recipes.

Here is a list of some features we're going to implement:

* List recipes _(`Query` operation)_
* Add a new recipe _(`Mutation` operation)_
* Launch and wait for the end of the cooking process _(`Subscription` operation)_
* Adding rate limiting on updating recipes _(How to implement `directives`)_
* Do not expose all your GraphQL API for everyone, limit the administration features, `Mutation`, to administrators.


## Initialization of the "Tartiflette recipes manager GraphQL API" project

Prepare your favorite editor and your Terminal, we will switch back and forth between them.

First, create the project's folder called `ttftt-recipes-manager`.
```bash
mkdir ttftt-recipes-manager/

# Move to the directory we just created
cd ttftt-recipes-manager
```

We will put all our python files into the python module `recipes_manager`.
```
mkdir -p recipes_manager
```

Moreover, we are going to create multiple files which will contain our application code.
* `recipes_manager/app.py`: Entrypoint of our application. In charge of the initialization of `tartiflette-aiohttp`.
* `recipes_manager/sdl`: Folder which will contain our SDL _(Schema Definition Language)_ files.
  * `recipes_manager/sdl/Query.graphql`: Schema with our Query objects.
  * `recipes_manager/sdl/Mutation.graphql`: Schema with our Mutation objects.
  * `recipes_manager/sdl/Subscription.graphql`: Schema with our Subscription objects.
* `recipes_manager/query_resolvers.py`: Will contain the Query resolvers.
* `recipes_manager/mutation_resolvers.py`: Will contain the Mutation resolvers.
* `recipes_manager/subscription_resolvers.py`: Will contain the Subscription resolvers.
* `recipes_manager/data.py`: Will contain the data used by the resolvers.
* `recipes_manager/directives/auth.py`: Will contain the logic of the directive `@auth`
* `recipes_manager/directives/rate_limiting.py`: Will contain the logic of the directive `@rateLimit`


```sh
mkdir -p recipes_manager/sdl recipes_manager/directives

touch recipes_manager/__init__.py
touch recipes_manager/__main__.py
touch recipes_manager/directives/__init__.py

touch recipes_manager/app.py
touch recipes_manager/sdl/Query.graphql
touch recipes_manager/sdl/Mutation.graphql
touch recipes_manager/sdl/Subscription.graphql
touch recipes_manager/query_resolvers.py
touch recipes_manager/mutation_resolvers.py
touch recipes_manager/subscription_resolvers.py
touch recipes_manager/data.py
touch recipes_manager/directives/auth.py
touch recipes_manager/directives/rate_limiting.py
```

Your tree should look something like this:

```bash
.
└── recipes_manager
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __main__.py
    ├── app.py
    ├── data.py
    ├── directives
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── auth.py
    │   └── rate_limiting.py
    ├── mutation_resolvers.py
    ├── query_resolvers.py
    ├── sdl
    │   ├── Mutation.graphql
    │   ├── Query.graphql
    │   └── Subscription.graphql
    └── subscription_resolvers.py

3 directories, 13 files
```

## Our data

We will need some data to execute `query`, `mutation` and `subscription`.

Fill the file **recipes_manager/data.py** with this data.

```python
# Dictionnary which contains the ingredients based on the
# Recipe ID as key.
INGREDIENTS = {
    1: [
        { "name": "potato", "quantity": 10, "type": "UNIT" },
        { "name": "onion", "quantity": 2, "type": "UNIT" },
        { "name": "bacon", "quantity": 100, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "white wine", "quantity": 0.05, "type": "LITER" },
        { "name": "reblochon AOP", "quantity": 1, "type": "UNIT" }
    ],
    2: [
        { "name": "potato", "quantity": 1000, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "bacon", "quantity": 200, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "onion", "quantity": 200, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "reblochon AOP", "quantity": 1, "type": "UNIT" },
        { "name": "tablespoon of oil", "quantity": 2, "type": "UNIT" },
        { "name": "clove of garlic", "quantity": 1, "type": "UNIT" },
    ],
    3: [
        { "name": "potato", "quantity": 1000, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "smoked bacon", "quantity": 200, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "onion", "quantity": 2, "type": "UNIT" },
        { "name": "reblochon AOP", "quantity": 1, "type": "UNIT" },
        { "name": "fresh cream", "quantity": 0.100, "type": "LITER" },
        { "name": "butter", "quantity": 40, "type": "GRAM" },
        { "name": "tablespoon of pepper", "quantity": 1, "type": "UNIT" },
    ]
}

RECIPES = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Tartiflette by Eric Guelpa",
        "cookingTime": 15
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "La 'vraie' Tartiflette",
        "cookingTime": 20
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Tartiflette by Alain Ducasse",
        "cookingTime": 25
    }
]
```

Let's start coding :tada:
